# loxFhem - Integrating Loxone home automation with FHEM


End of 2016 I started extending my Loxone homeautomation by FHEM components. In here, you will find some documentation, code snippets and links for further information.

###Basics:
* [Loxone](http://www.loxone.com) is a company from Austria, which sells (among other products) the so called *Loxone Miniserver*. Its a propriety solution. 
	* I had realised light, heating and jalousies with Loxone. Technically, Loxone (wired) requires a star topology cabeling; however, several extensions are available to integrate with other systems (such as Enocean, 1-Wire or KNX).
* [FHEM](http://fhem.de/) is an (if not *the*) open source solution for home automation. Several systems can be connected.
	* I plan to integrate via Enocean a wheather station, window sensors (open|close), water sensors (lacking washing machine), as well as a simple LED panel.
