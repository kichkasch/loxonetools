loxFhem - Integrating Loxone home automation with FHEM
======================================================

End of 2016 I started extending my Loxone homeautomation by FHEM components. In here, you will find some documation, code snippets and links for further information.

Basics:
* Loxone (http://www.loxone.com) is a company from Austria, which sells (among others) the so called Loxone Miniserver. Its a propriety solution. 
** I had realised light, heating and jalousies with Loxone. Technically, Loxone (wired) requires a star topology cabeling; however, several extensions are available to integrate with other systems (such as Enocean, 1-Wire or KNX).
