# loxFhem - Integrating Loxone home automation with FHEM


End of 2016 I started extending my Loxone homeautomation by FHEM/HomeMatic components. In here, you will find some documentation, code snippets and links for further information.

###Background:
* [Loxone](http://www.loxone.com) is a company from Austria, which sells (among other products) the so called *Loxone Miniserver*. Its a propriety solution. 
	* I had realised light, heating and jalousies with Loxone. Technically, Loxone (wired) requires a star topology cabeling; however, several extensions are available to integrate with other systems (such as Enocean, 1-Wire or KNX).
* [FHEM](http://fhem.de/) is an (if not *the*) open source solution for home automation. Several systems can be connected.
* [HomeMatic]	

I plan to integrate via HomeMatic a wheather station, window sensors (open|close), water sensors (lacking washing machine), as well as a simple LED panel.

###Hardware

Getting the hardware right: 

* Loxone side: I have had the (Loxone Miniserver)[http://www.loxone.com/enen/products/miniserver/miniserver.html] in place already.
* FHEM side: FHEM may be installed on quite some devices; such as AVM Fritzbox, several NAS system or Rasperry - check (offical FHEM website)[http://fhem.de/fhem.html#Links] for an overview.
	* As FHEM also runs perfectly on any Debian Linux, I decided to install it on my already existing [Plug Computer](https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/c-14-gtimirabox.aspx). Straight foreward installation instructions for Debian are provided by [FHEM project](https://debian.fhem.de/) itself.	
* HomeMatic side: There are several ways on extending FHEM by HomeMatic. Check again [(German) FHEM wiki](http://www.fhemwiki.de/wiki/HomeMatic#Fhem_als_Zentrale) for an overview.
	* I decided to go for the [USB CUL (CC1101)](http://www.fhemwiki.de/wiki/CUL) and got one for around 40 â‚¬ from Ebay.
